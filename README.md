How do you get better at writing code in Java? Practice, practice, practice. Test your skill set as a Java developer by working through these hands-on practical challenges. In this course, instructor Kathryn Hodge presents a variety of concise coding challenges, each running about five minutes or less, that give you an opportunity to try out your Java skills, whether you’re a beginner, intermediate, or advanced user. Each lesson has been designed independently, so you can skip around and watch them in any order that works for you. One challenge at a time, Kathryn provides an overview of solutions and automated testing files. By the end of this course, you’ll have developed a brand-new set of skills in Java, along with some tricks of the trade that software developers in the industry use every day.<br><br>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace.<br><br>Each installment of the <em>Level Up</em> series offers at least 15 bite-sized opportunities to practice programming at various levels of difficulty, so you can challenge yourself and reinforce what you’ve learned.
